Welcome to your settings folder! A quick overview:

 - settings.json contains your general settings
   - "honor_rating" enables or disables showing higher rated pictures by default, set to "true" to enable, "false" to disable
   - "transition_speed" controls how fast the fade transition between photos takes, in seconds
   - "show_for" controls how long pictures are shown for, in seconds

 - the folders with one or more "x" for the name are where you should put your pictures
   - Think of it like a 5-star rating system. Except the stars are "x"s
   - the more "x"s in the name, the more your smart picture frame will show those photos
